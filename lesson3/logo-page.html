        <h2>Description of the target</h2>
        <p>
          According to the main purpose of this project, we will have several
          target audiences for our website. There are many people in this
          country who are unknown where to get easy and trusted information
          about parts and accessories. Many of these people fall into traps
          (fakes) or even worst, they waste valuable time searching for
          information. Through this website, we will bring real and flexible
          information for all people who are looking for general or specific
          requirements. All these requirements include prices, offers, stocks,
          staff contact, etc. Just to make mention, we could include
          businessmen, engineers, young people, fathers, mothers, etc. Finally,
          it’s important to mention that our target audience will include people
          who are learning how to use the computer or people which have any
          disability. We say this because most of the content is very intuitive
          and easy to understand.
