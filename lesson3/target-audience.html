        <h2>Description of the target</h2>
        <p>
          According to the main purpose of this project, we will have several
          target audiences for our website. Just to make mention, the target
          audience will include families, businessmen, engineers, young people,
          fathers, mothers, foreign people, etc. There are many people in this
          country who are unknown where to go on vacation or enjoy visiting
          relaxing places. Many of these people fall into traps (fakes) or even
          worst, they waste valuable time searching for some tourist place.
          Through this website, we will offer real and trusted information to
          all people who are looking for a general or specific type of place to
          visit. All of this information will include prices, offers, tourist
          packages, staff contact, etc.
